     <h1> Games </h1>
  <p>   Welcome to my virtual game corner!</p> 
<p>Here, I invite you to take a break from the ordinary and dive into a world of interactive fun. 
  As a UX researcher, I believe in crafting delightful experiences, and what better way to showcase who 
  I am than through a small game I've coded just for you?
  </p>
<p>This game is more than just a playful addition; it's another connecting point to experience my design & my personality 
utilizing the software Scratch for the gameplay, photoshop for the pixel art.
With the user in mind, this game offers a quick break while appreciating icons found in mexican culture.</p>
  <p><i>Oh and yes... you can borrow my gameboy :)</i></p>
